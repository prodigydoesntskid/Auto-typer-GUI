Whether you need to automate typing for "chat packing," generate creative wordlists, automate Discord tasks, or consult with a powerful AI, this suite has you covered. The interface is built with `customtkinter` for a modern, responsive feel.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

This tool contains powerful automation features. Some of these features, particularly the **AR Bot** and **GC Changer**, may violate Discord's Terms of Service and can lead to account suspension or termination.

> [!WARNING]
> **Use at Your Own Risk!** The developer is not responsible for any bans or other disciplinary actions taken against your account. The **GC Changer** is especially high-risk and is almost guaranteed to be detected by Discord. Never use these features on an account you are not willing to lose. Be smart and responsible.

Never share your `settings.json` file, as it may contain sensitive information like your Discord token and AI API key.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system. The application also requires several Python libraries.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/prodigy-suite.git
    cd prodigy-suite
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    The application requires `customtkinter`, `pyautogui`, `pynput`, and several libraries for the AI and Discord features. Install them all with pip:
    ```sh
    pip install customtkinter pyautogui pynput
    pip install discord.py
    pip install google-generativeai pillow
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python a.py
    ```

## How to Use

### Global Hotkeys

-   **`F2`**: Start / Stop the Auto Typer macro.
-   **`F6`**: Un-hide (deiconify) the application window if it's minimized.
-   **`F8`**: Instantly save settings and close the application.

### Tab 1: Auto Typer

This is the core "chat packing" tool.

1.  **Create a Text File**: Create a `.txt` file. Write each message you want the typer to send. **Separate each message with a blank line (two newlines)**.
2.  **Load File**: Click `Load Text File (.txt)` and select your file.
3.  **Set Speed**: Adjust the `WPM` slider to control the typing speed.
4.  **Set Delay**: Adjust the `Delay Between Messages` slider to control the pause after each message is sent.
5.  **Hide from Capture (Windows Only)**: Check this box to make the application window appear black in screenshots and screen shares.
6.  **Activate**: Click on the chat box where you want to type, then press `F2` to start the macro. Press `F2` again to stop it.

### Tab 2: AR (Auto-Reply) Bot

Automatically replies to a specific user.

1.  **Discord Token**: Paste your Discord account token.
2.  **Target User ID**: Paste the User ID of the person you want to auto-reply to.
3.  **Reply Message**: Enter the message you want to send as a reply.
4.  **Start/Stop**: Click the button to start or stop the bot. The status label will indicate if it's running.

### Tab 3: GC (Group Chat) Changer

> [!CAUTION]
> **EXTREMELY HIGH BAN RISK.** This feature spams Discord's API and is easily detectable.

1.  **Discord Token**: Paste your Discord account token.
2.  **Group Chat ID**: Paste the ID of the group chat you want to rename.
3.  **Base Name**: Enter the base text for the name change (e.g., " raided"). The bot will append a counter (e.g., " raided 1", " raided 2").
4.  **Start/Stop**: Click the button to start or stop the spam.

### Tab 4: WordList Generator

Create custom wordlists for the Auto Typer.

1.  **Configure**: Set your desired options:
    -   `Target Name`: An optional name to include in the generated lines.
    -   `Number of Lines`: How many unique lines to generate.
    -   `Use Start/End Phrase`: Adds conversational bookends to the phrases.
    -   `Enable Typos`: Randomly introduces human-like typos.
    -   `Text Case`: Force uppercase, lowercase, or a random mix.
    -   `Prefix Symbol`: Add a symbol like `#` or `+` before each line.
2.  **Generate**: Click `Generate WordList`.
3.  **Save**: A file dialog will appear, allowing you to save the generated list as a `.txt` file, ready to be used by the Auto Typer.

### Tab 5: AI Chat (Gemini)

Leverage Google's Gemini AI for conversation, brainstorming, or content generation.

1.  **Get API Key**: You need a Google AI API key. You can get one for free from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  **Initialize**: Paste your API key into the entry field and click `Set Key & Init`. The status label will confirm a successful connection.
3.  **Chat**:
    -   Type your message in the text box at the bottom.
    -   Optionally, click `Attach Image` to include an image in your prompt.
    -   Press `Shift+Enter` or click `Send` to submit your prompt.
    -   The conversation will appear in the chat window.

## Configuration

Your settings for all tabs are automatically saved to `settings.json` when you close the application or press `F8`. This allows you to retain your tokens, IDs, and slider preferences between sessions.
